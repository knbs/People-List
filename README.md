This is a sample of using React with redux and some other libraries as immutable that helps to manage better the global state.

## How to run

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so you can use the usual commands for running or build the app.

Remember to run `npm install` to download all the required dependencies. Run `npm start` to rapidly have the app working.  
Test it!!!

As following below, you can run any of the commands from the root directory:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
